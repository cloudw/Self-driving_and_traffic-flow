# Effects of Self-driving Car to Traffic Flow and Policy

The paper models effects of traffic flow for mulitple-lane highway without traffic light, and analyze dedicated lane policy. It is based on paper "Highway Capacity Benefits from Using Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication and Sensors for Collision Avoidance" by Tientrakool, P., Ho, Y., & Maxemchuk, N. (2011), and LWR Models with Triangular Fundamental Diagram. 

This is a paper written within 4 days for MCM 2017 (Mathematics Contest in Modeling) Problem C, with none of the team member having background in traffic flow or self-driving vehicle before. Therefore minor errors are expected due to time constraint.
